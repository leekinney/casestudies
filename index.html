			<h2>Home health care company gets mobile-first redesign and design refresh.</h2>
			<p>The redesign of <a href='https://www.bayada.com/''>bayada.com</a> improved bounce rate, page speed and improved accessibility considerations.</p>

			<h3>About BAYADA Home Health Care</h3>
			<p>BAYADA Home Health Care is a trusted leader in providing clinical care and support services at home for children and adults of all ages. Since 1975, the company has been at the forefront of the home health care movement â€” working to give people greater access to high-quality care that helps them live safely at home.</p>

			<h3>Challenges</h3>
			<p>The BAYADA website was in need of major updates when I was brought on to the team. The design was dated, had accessibility issues and was not mobile-friendly. The legacy code was almost unmanageable, and the image and file structure was inconsistent and unintuitive. </p>

			<h3>Improvements</h3>
			<p>My first step was to go through and clean up the HTML files, refactoring many of the pages to be semantic and compliant with basic accessibility standards.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Combining and minimizing files</li>
					<li>Leveraging browser caching</li>
					<li>Gzip compression</li>
					<li>Image optimization</li>
					<li>Removing IDs and renaming classes</li>
				</ul>

			<h3>Accessibility considerations</h3>
			<p>There were many issues with the current features of the site being inaccessible. Only the top level navigation items were accessible when tabbing through without a mouse and there was no way to skip over it to access important content. The font color palette provided by the brand guidelines did not provide enough contrast on a white background and was often used over other background colors, providing even less contrast.</p>
			<p>Almost all of the images did not have alt text and the ones that did were done incorrectly, sometimes containing dashes or underscores or repeating the file name. Many of the hero images were created with a text overlay that did not have enough contrast and were done as an image. There were quite a few instances where text was done as an image instead of styling with CSS. This was troublesome as most examples were a call-to-action or button that would not be apparent to someone using the site with a screen reader. Using these images instead of CSS also added to the image bulk and slowed the pages down.</p>

			<p>Some of the accessibility considerations include, but are not limited to:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Skip-to navigation</li>
					<li>Increased font-size and contrast</li>
					<li>Image alt tags</li>
					<li>Reworked drop down menu to be able to tab through</li>
					<li>Removed image carousels throughout site</li>
				</ul>

			<h3>Outcomes of the redesign</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>The responsive redesign allows more users to view the site across multiple devices and browsers</li>
					<li>Bounce rate improved by 28.73%</li>
					<li>Organic traffic increased</li>
					<li>Improved page speed by over 10%</li>
				</ul>

					<figcaption>The next iteration of the website removed drop shadows and gradients, going for a more flat design. We also added an &ldquo;I want to&rdquo; section to the navigation to attempt to get users to the 3 most visited pages of the site as quickly as possible.</figcaption>

					<figcaption>After reviewing user paths and analytics, we discovered the &ldquo;I want to&rdquo; menu wasn't being used in the way we had assumed. With this iteration, we really cleaned up the design, removing a lot of the unnecessary noise. We also lightened the weight and removed the gradient background from the icons and added two clear, calls-to-action, allowing users to quickly get to the recruiting site or to find services.</figcaption>

					<figcaption>The current design of bayada.com now has a simpler navigation with larger, more predominant font and better use of whitespace in the header section. After running various A/B tests we found that users were more likely to click on the buttons that only used the words &ldquo;jobs&rdquo; and &ldquo;services&rdquo;.</figcaption>
